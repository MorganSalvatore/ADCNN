How to build VTM
================

The software uses CMake to create platform-specific build files. 

Build instructions for plain CMake (suggested)
----------------------------------------------

**Note:** A working CMake installation is required for building the software.

CMake generates configuration files for the compiler environment/development environment on each platform. 
The following is a list of examples for Windows (MS Visual Studio), macOS (Xcode) and Linux (make).

Open a command prompt on your system and change into the root directory of this project.

Create a build directory in the root directory:
```bash
mkdir build 
```

Use one of the following CMake commands, based on your platform. Feel free to change the commands to satisfy
your needs.

**Windows Visual Studio 2015 64 Bit:**
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
```
Then open the generated solution file in MS Visual Studio.

**macOS Xcode:**
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -G "Xcode"
```
Then open the generated work space in Xcode.

**Linux**

For generating Linux Release Makefile:
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
For generating Linux Debug Makefile:
```bash
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Then type
```bash
make -j
```

For more details, refer to the CMake documentation: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/

Build instructions for make
---------------------------

**Note:** The build instructions in this section require the make tool and Python to be installed, which are
part of usual Linux and macOS environments. See below for installation instruction for Python and GnuWin32 
on Windows.

Open a command prompt on your system and change into the root directory of this project.

To use the default system compiler simply call:
```bash
make all
```
For MSYS2 and MinGW: Open an MSYS MinGW 64-Bit terminal and change into the root directory of this project.

Call:
```bash
make all toolset=gcc
```


Tool Installation on Windows
----------------------------
Download CMake: http://www.cmake.org/ and install it.

Python and GnuWin32 are not mandatory, but they simplify the build process for the user.

python:    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/

gnuwin32:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/getgnuwin32/0.6.30/GetGnuWin32-0.6.3.exe/download

To use MinGW, install MSYS2: http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/msys2-x86_64-latest.exe

Installation instructions: https://www.msys2.org/

Install the needed toolchains:
```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain git subversion mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
```
